# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
honestly a lot of it didnt make much sense and I had to follow Mr. Berg trough a lot of the coding but after doing it all and writing out the finished product, everything became more clear to me how each function worked with each other to get to the final product. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
The match function can be used to match patterns from an actual movie database to find correlations and similarities in information to be shown to the user. The match function can be used to process the data from the database through pattern recognition, etc.
